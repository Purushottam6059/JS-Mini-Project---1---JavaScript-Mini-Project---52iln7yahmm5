  <p>
   Max Healthcare Institute Limited ("Max Healthcare") is one of India’s largest healthcare organizations. We operate 17 healthcare facilities (3400+ beds) across the NCR Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Maharashtra. Almost 85% of our bed capacity is in Metro/Tier 1 cities. Apart from hospitals, Max Healthcare also operates a homecare business and pathology business under brand names Max@Home and Max Labs respectively.  Max@Home offers health and wellness services at home while Max Lab provides Pathology Services outside our hospital network.

Max Healthcare is promoted and led by Abhay Soi as its Chairman and Managing director and co- promoted by KKR, the iconic Global Private equity fund.

The present amalgamated company was formed subsequent to the acquisition of 49.7% stake in erstwhile Max Healthcare Institute Limited by Radiant Life Care Pvt. Ltd. ( “Radiant”) and the amalgamation of Max Healthcare with Radiant thereafter.  The amalgamated entity assumed the name Max Healthcare Institute limited.  Prior to the amalgamation, Radiant  was led and promoted by Abhay Soi.
